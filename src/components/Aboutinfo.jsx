    <b>Hello!</b> I&apos;m Avishkar Deogharia, a driven and creative full-stack developer currently in my third year of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I specialize in building responsive, scalable, and engaging web applications using modern technologies, with a strong focus on delivering practical and intuitive user experiences.
  </p>

  <p>
    My frontend expertise includes <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</b>, and a deep proficiency in <b>React</b> and <b>Tailwind CSS</b>. I&apos;ve used these to build several interactive interfaces, and have streamlined development with tools like <b>Vite</b>. I&apos;ve also worked with <b>Framer Motion</b> for animations and have applied responsive design principles to ensure usability across devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the backend, I develop using <b>Node.js</b>, <b>Express.js</b>, and have adopted <b>Next.js</b> for building full-stack applications with server-side rendering. My database work centers around <b>MongoDB</b> with <b>Mongoose</b>, and I&apos;m experienced with secure auth flows using <b>JWT</b> and <b>NextAuth</b>. I&apos;ve also built features using <b>localStorage</b> for client-side persistence where needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    My recent projects include <b>StoryCrafter</b> — an AI-powered content generation platform; <b>Noggle</b> — a real-time chat application; and <b>NexCart</b> — a minimal e-commerce experience. Each project has strengthened my skills in state management, REST API integration, authentication, and UI consistency.
  </p>

  <p>
    I&apos;m continuously learning, exploring advanced concepts in web development and DevOps, and working toward creating impactful solutions. Thank you for stopping by — I look forward to sharing more of my journey with you!
